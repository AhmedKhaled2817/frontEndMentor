                    <p class="lead">Argentina native Lionel Messi has established records for goals scored and won individual awards en route to worldwide recognition as one of the best players in soccer.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, soccer player Lionel Messi moved to Spain at the age of 13, after the FC Barcelona club agreed to pay for hormone-deficiency treatments. Messi became a star in his new country, leading his club to championships. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year, and in 2016, he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the fifth time.</p>

                        Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks, and by the age of 16, he had made his first appearance for Barcelona. Messi put himself in the record books on May 1, 2005, as the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Messi drew comparisons to Diego Maradona for his attacking style. In 2009, Barcelona captured the Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles, and Messi took home his first Ballon d'Or award. 
                        In 2012, he broke the record for most goals in a calendar year. In 2015, after more wins with Barcelona, he was honored with his fifth FIFA Ballon d'Or trophy.
